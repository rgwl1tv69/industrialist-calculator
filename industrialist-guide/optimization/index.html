    <h1>Industrialist Guide 1: <b>Optimization</b></h1>
    <a href="../index.html">back to guides list</a>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Many newer players struggle with finding optimal ratios, setups, etc. This
      guide will provide many setups for the early game, mid game, late game,
      and end game.
    </p>
    <h2>Early Beginnings</h2>
    <p>
      You are given a few coal drills and a solar panel to begin
      industrializing. Complete the tutorial and figure out how to connect pipes
      together. Then, start expanding your factory by buying more solar panels
      and coal drills. Once you obtain $1k, you can now move on to the copper
      stage. Invest in Research Stations to unlock Copper, Coal Generators, and
      Water Pumps. In the Copper Stage, you must drill copper using the Copper
      Drill, smelting them with Electric Furnaces, and molding them with Ingot
      Molders to create Copper Ingots. For every 3 Copper Drills, 1 Electric
      Furnace and 1/3 Ingot Molder is needed. This produces 0.5 Copper Ingots/s,
      or about $13/s. Since it is very slow, mass produce Copper Ingots until
      you obtain $5k. Research Presses and Rollers. For each Ingot Molder, 1.55
      Presses and 3.1 Rollers are needed. Presses go first and Rollers go
      second. Research the LV Pole for Power transfer. From this setup, you will
      make roughly 5 copper wires per second, which is approximately $37/s. Tip:
      For maximum efficiency, always round up amounts of machines with decimals.
      Obtain $200k from mass-producing wires. Research Trees. Move on.
    </p>
    <h2>Mid-Life crisis</h2>
    <p>
      The Industrialist Community is obsessed with Iron Coils. Unfortunately
      without using Iron Mix (secret recipes) it makes less than copper wires.
      So quickly research Steel before a shadow creep named Stan visits your
      factory! Well now Iron Coils are useless, make Steel Plates instead. You
      could make coke fuel for increasing iron production. However it is not
      recommended as coke fuel needs trees at this stage of the game. Trees also
      take a lot of space. Instead, just make Steel regularly. Put Iron and Coal
      into a Blast Furnace, making Steel. You should learn how to calculate
      ratios by now (unless you're in the 2nd grade ðŸ’€.) Put the Steel into a
      couple of presses, and congratulations you made Steel Plates. Then upgrade
      to
      <a href="https://industrialist.miraheze.org/wiki/Iron_Mix">Iron Mix</a>.
      The link I have just provided is the Industrialist Wiki. Use it for
      recipes and ratios. A good goal is making 10 Steel Plates per second ($889/s). Since now you have industrialized you can use Coke Fuel. Iron Coils also take a lot of truck space which is another flaw.
      Obtain $1.5M. A new tutorial will be created soon.
